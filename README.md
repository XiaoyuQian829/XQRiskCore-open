## 🧭 System Origins & Design Philosophy

**Most risk systems weren’t built for today’s rules.**  
Permissions tangled. Logs missing. Controls patched on outdated cores.  
When failures happen, it’s already too late.

**XQRiskCore** responds to structural fatigue — not to predict alpha, but to enforce discipline **before** trades happen.

> **Governance isn’t a wrapper. It’s the foundation.**

---

### 🔍 What Went Wrong — and What I Built to Fix It

I studied 10 major failures — not for drama, but to see what broke:

| 💥 Failure Type         | Example(s)                  | What Went Wrong                                          | XQRiskCore Response                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 🔐 Role confusion       | Barings, SocGen, FTX         | No separation — same user could approve + execute       | `RBAC` enforces scoped roles                     |
| 🧾 No audit trail       | Enron, Wirecard, Macquarie   | Logs missing, falsified, or unverifiable                | `AuditLogger`, `AuditViewer`, immutable `.jsonl` |
| 🛑 No auto-block        | Macquarie, Lehman, MF Global | Signals existed — no structural trigger or lockdown     | `SilentTriggerEngine`, `KillSwitchManager`       |
| 🧟 Legacy code risk     | Knight Capital               | Old logic reactivated, no sandbox or fallback           | `Intent → Approval → Execution` lifecycle        |
| 📉 Model overtrust      | LTCM, FTX                    | Smart models, zero enforceable guardrails               | `RiskSignalSet`, override tracking               |

---

### 🧱 Built Bottom-Up — By Principle, Not Convention

**Every trade follows the same lifecycle:**  
`Intent → Signals → Approval → Execution → Audit → Monitoring`

**Priority is hardcoded into the system:**

| Layer                        | Priority | Goal                    | Stability | Build First |
|-----------------------------|----------|-------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| ✅ Compliance / Audit        | First    | Trust, accountability   | ✅ High    | ✅ Yes       |
| ✅ Risk Engine (Rules + Score) | Second   | Block risky behavior     | ⚠️ Medium  | ✅ Yes       |
| 🧑‍💼 Execution / Strategy     | Third    | Trigger actions          | ❌ Low     | ❌ No        |

Enforced by:
- 🔐 Role-based access (RBAC)
- 🔍 Structured logging
- 🛡️ Multi-stage kill switches
- 🧠 Unified approval flow

---

## 📚 Institutional Inspirations

**XQRiskCore** borrows lessons from world-class systems — but flips the build order.

✅ Inspired & embedded in v1.0:
- **BlackRock Aladdin** — Unified trade flow; scoped permissions; audit attribution  
- **J.P. Morgan Vega / RaaS** — Pre- and post-trade enforcement  
- **Goldman Sachs Marquee** — Structured logging and behavior traceability  

🧪 Future targets:
- **Beacon / Vega** — Rule hot-swapping, versioned policy control  
- **Bridgewater / Two Sigma** — Adaptive scoring, live feedback loops  

But unlike these systems, XQRiskCore wasn’t built inside a bank.  
It was built from scratch — solo — to prove a principle:

> You don’t need to be big to enforce discipline.  
> You just need to build like you mean it.

🎧 [Theme Track: The Core](https://youtu.be/OsUe84mkLhg)  
**Structured. Watchful. Unyielding.**

---

## ✅ Core Capabilities

### 1. 🔁 Unified Trade Flow — One Pipe for All Trades

Unlike most systems that separate manual, strategy, and rebalance trades,  
**XQRiskCore unifies them into a single pipeline** — one that enforces **the same approval logic**, **risk checks**, and **audit trace**.

No trade escapes the flow.  
Every source — whether it’s a button click, a strategy trigger, or a scheduled rebalance — must go through:

→ Intent → Risk Signal → Approval → Execution → Audit → Post-Trade Monitoring

#### 📊 Figure 1: XQRiskCore Risk-Controlled Trade Lifecycle
![Trade Flow](assets/xq_tradeflow.png)

🧩 Want to understand how this unified trade pipeline actually works under the hood?

📄 [See `01_unified_trade_flow.md`](01_unified_trade_flow.md)

Included:

- 🎯 The philosophy behind `TradeIntent` — “a trade is a trade, regardless of source”
- 📦 Side-by-side examples of manual vs strategy-generated intents
- 🔒 How pre-block mechanisms (Kill Switch, Silent Mode) intercept trades before execution
- ✅ How the Risk Approval Engine evaluates score, volatility, and VaR
- 📊 Full trade lifecycle from intent → approval → execution → audit
- 🧠 How this structure ensures **policy consistency**, **traceability**, and **enforceable compliance**

---

### 2. 🧠 Dual-Path Risk Control Architecture

XQRiskCore enforces risk through two layers:

- **Pre-Trade Approval** — blocks high-risk trades before execution  
- **Post-Trade Monitoring** — detects exposures and auto-locks after execution

#### 1️⃣ Pre-Trade Approval

Every trade — manual, strategy, or rebalance — passes a unified approval flow before execution. This is the core of XQRiskCore’s institutional-grade risk governance.

#### 🧯 2️⃣ Post-Trade Monitoring — Risk Trigger System

After execution, XQRiskCore continuously monitors positions using:

- ⚡ `IntradayTriggerEngine` — real-time risk detection  
- 🌙 `SilentTriggerEngine` — end-of-day lockout review

If any account- or asset-level threshold is breached, the system activates:

- **Silent Mode** — temporary cooldown  
- **Kill Switch** — full lockout  

---

##### 🧮 Account-Level Triggers

| Condition                          | Metric           | Action             | Module                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Intraday drawdown ≤ -5%           | `drawdown`       | Silent Mode (2d)    | Intraday               |
| Daily return ≤ -5%                | `daily_return`   | Silent Mode (2d)    | Silent                 |
| Monthly return ≤ -10%             | `monthly_return` | Silent Mode (EOM)   | Silent                 |
| ≥ 3 consecutive losing days       | `consecutive_losses` | Silent Mode (1d) | Silent                 |

> 💡 These act as portfolio-level brakes when losses accumulate or behavior destabilizes.

---

##### 📦 Asset-Level Triggers

| Condition                        | Metric                 | Threshold | Lock    | Module(s)              |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|---------|-------------------------|
| Position drawdown ≤ -7%         | `pos_drawdown`          | -7%       | 3 days  | Intraday               |
| 3-day drawdown ≤ -10%           | `drawdown_3d`           | -10%      | 7 days  | Silent                 |
| Live drawdown ≤ -15%            | `drawdown_pct`          | -15%      | 7 days  | Silent                 |
| ≥ 3 down days                   | `consecutive_down_days` | 3         | 7 days  | Intraday + Silent      |
| One-day move ≥ ±8%              | `(cur - prev) / prev`   | ±8%       | 7 days  | Intraday + Silent      |
| Slippage ≥ 0.5%                 | `last_slippage_pct`     | 0.5%      | 7 days  | Intraday + Silent      |

> 📌 Asset-level blocks prevent repeat exposure to stressed instruments and slippage-heavy trades.

📄 [See `02_intray&&daily_trigger.md`](02_intray&&daily_trigger.md)  
Covers:

- 🛰️ Real-time vs EOD trigger engine design  
- ⚡ Key thresholds: drawdown, volatility, slippage  
- 🔁 Audit integration and override traceability  
- 🔍 Per-client monitoring logic

---

##### 🧠 Future Enhancements

- **Black Swan KillSwitch** — e.g. S&P500 drops > 5% triggers lockdown  
- **Slow Burn Lockdown** — 5 small losses without major drop triggers cooling phase

---

#### 🧬 Monitoring Philosophy

> Approve what deserves to go through.  
> Monitor everything that actually did.

XQRiskCore turns logging into **automated containment** — high-risk behavior is not just observed, but structurally blocked.


---

### 3. 🧱 Role-Based Governance (RBAC)

Every role in XQRiskCore is **scoped by permission**, **linked to identity**, and **logged for accountability**.

| Functional Area                        | Role               | Status         |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Config & Access Control                | `admin`            | ✅ Implemented |
| Manual Trade Execution                 | `trader`           | ✅ Implemented |
| Risk Approval & Rule Enforcement       | `risker`           | ✅ Implemented |
| Audit & Log Review                     | `auditor`          | ✅ Implemented |
| Strategy Research                      | `quant_researcher` | ✅ Implemented |
| Report Generation                      | `reporter`         | 🔧 Coming Soon |
| Compliance Oversight                   | `compliance_officer` | 🔧 Coming Soon |
| Strategy Signal Execution              | `strategy_agent`   | 🔧 Coming Soon |

#### 🔐 Governance Design Principles

- **What you see** = info scope  
- **What you can do** = last line of control  
- **What you trigger** = traceable decision path  
- **What gets logged** = structured compliance proof

All actions are **recorded and reviewable** — aligned with institutional-grade role separation and auditability.

- 🛡️ Wall-Street-grade access control principles

---

#### 4. 🧾 Structured Behavioral Logging

XQRiskCore logs **every user and system action** as structured metadata — enabling traceability, compliance, and post-trade forensics.

##### 🧩 Action Types

| Type     | Description                      | Example                                |
|----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `view`   | Passive interactions             | Opened a dashboard                     |
| `action` | User-initiated operations        | Submitted a trade                      |
| `system` | Automated system behavior        | Triggered Silent Mode                  |

##### 🗂️ File Format & Storage

Logs are saved in newline-delimited JSON (`.jsonl`), partitioned by role, user, and date:

```
audit/user_action_logs/{role}/{user_id}/{YYYY-MM-DD}/events.jsonl
```


Each file captures timestamped, structured records.

##### 🔍 Admin Log Viewer

- 👉 [Login as `admin1`](https://xqriskcore-production.up.railway.app) → `Admin → User Action Logs`  
  → Filter by user or role to view actions: **viewed**, **submitted**, **overrode**, or **rejected** — all immutably stored.

⬇️ UI Preview  
<img width="1304" alt="User Action Log Viewer" src="assets/xq_user_logs.png" />

##### 🧠 Why It Matters

Risk officers don’t log for vanity — they log for **moments that matter**:

- 🕵️ Regulatory investigations  
- 🧾 Internal audits  
- ⚖️ Disputes & legal defense  
- 💼 Board accountability

Logs aren’t debugging tools — they’re **compliance weapons**.

##### 📌 Logged Fields

Each action includes:

- `user_id` – who did it  
- `timestamp` – when  
- `module` – where  
- `action` – what  
- `status`, `override_flag` – approved, rejected, bypassed  
- `trace_path` – who was involved  

These feed:

- 🔍 Anomaly detection  
- 📊 Risk reporting  
- 🧠 Strategy attribution  
- 🧾 Compliance tracebacks

---

### 🛡️ Emergency Guard Layer

XQRiskCore’s final line of defense — enforcing **stability**, **audit integrity**, and **strategy discipline**, even under failure or attack.

It’s designed to **fail safe**, not fail silently.

#### ✅ Active Safeguards

| Module                | Function                                                        | Status    |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `SystemGuard`         | Blocks execution if core services (API/data) go down            | ✅ Active |
| `StrategyThrottler`   | Suspends overly frequent or failing strategies                  | ✅ Active |
| `TradeAuditFailSafe`  | Cancels trades if audit logs cannot persist                     | ✅ Active |
| `KillSwitchManager`   | Locks accounts/assets on risk breach                            | ✅ Active |
| `runtime_controls.py` | UI trigger for emergency lockdowns                              | ✅ Active |

These guards keep the system **governable, observable, and survivable** — even when strategies break or infrastructure degrades.

📄 [See `04_emergency_guard_layer.md`](04_emergency_guard_layer.md)  
Covers:

- 🛡️ Failure containment: audit loss, system outages, runaway logic  
- ⚙️ Modules: `SystemGuard`, `KillSwitchManager`, `AuditFailSafe`  
- 🔁 Lifecycle hooks: pre-trade, post-trade, override-stage  
- 🔍 Full-traceability across manual, strategy, and auto execution  
- 🔒 Planned: circuit breakers, alerting, privileged override audits

### 🧩 Service Interface Abstraction

To demonstrate modular engineering capability and support SDK-like integration, core services in **XQRiskCore** have been refactored into interface classes. These interfaces decouple logic from orchestration, enabling independent testing, service injection, and future API exposure.

#### ✅ Implemented Service Interfaces

| Interface Class            | Role Description                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `TradeFlowService`         | Unified trade lifecycle execution interface       |
| `RiskEvaluatorService`     | Risk signal generation and approval logic         |
| `StrategySignalService`    | Strategy-based trade intent generation            |
| `MarketDataService`        | Market price and history access abstraction       |

These classes can be imported and invoked independently, allowing for flexible integration and precise control over each layer:

```python
svc = TradeFlowService(ctx)
result = svc.submit(intent)

risk = RiskEvaluatorService(ctx)
signals = risk.evaluate(intent)

market = MarketDataService()
price = market.get_latest_price("AAPL")
```

## 🧮 Functional Overview

**XQRiskCore** unifies trade routing, approval, control, and audit into a single, enforceable lifecycle.  
Every trade — regardless of origin — must pass through the same discipline.

### 🔒 Integrated Risk Coverage

Controls span all three major financial risk classes:

- **Market Risk** — volatility, VaR breaches, drawdowns  
  → Mitigated via scoring, KillSwitches, and asset-level lockdowns

- **Operational Risk** — execution errors, unauthorized behavior, audit gaps  
  → Controlled through intent approvals, Silent Mode, and structured logging

- **Governance Risk** — role overreach, invisible actions, policy bypass  
  → Enforced via RBAC, permission scoping, audit chains, and cooling-off

### ⚙️ Core System Capabilities

- ✅ **Unified trade flow** — All sources pass through one approval pipeline  
- ✅ **Built-in risk control** — VaR limits, KillSwitches, and Silent Mode  
- ✅ **Structured audit logs** — Action metadata: `user_id`, `timestamp`, `action`, `status`, trace path  
- ✅ **Client-specific config** — Per-client assets, strategies, and risk rules  
- ✅ **Role-based governance** — RBAC with behavioral logging and scope control

## 📌 Use Cases

XQRiskCore solves a simple but critical problem:  
🧠 *How do we ensure every trade — regardless of origin — is reviewed, executed, and recorded under a defensible system?*

It answers governance-level questions most systems avoid:

- **Who approves — and under what logic?**  
- **Can biased decisions be structurally blocked?**  
- **Are risk outcomes traceable by design?**  
- **Can strategy failures be traced to their source?**

Built for:

- ✅ **Multi-strategy fund desks** needing unified, explainable risk control  
- ✅ **Asset managers** seeking auditable governance without enterprise overhead  
- ✅ **Quant teams** requiring lifecycle tracking and approval scoring  
- ✅ **Compliance-focused firms** needing logs, overrides, and policy enforcement  
- ✅ **Risk officers and auditors** demanding traceable decision chains

Because risk isn’t just about limits — it’s about **structure, traceability, and responsibility**.

## 🌱 Evolution by Design

Every module is built for upgrades — not hard rewrites.

- New rules? Add via YAML.  
- New scores? Extend plug-ins.  
- New roles? RBAC handles it.  
- New audits? Log and trace.

**Governance evolves. So does XQRiskCore.**

## 🧬 Who Am I?

I’m a graduating PhD in statistical genetics, where I specialized in modeling complex systems and risk behavior.  
**XQ** is my name.

While preparing for the **FRM Part 1** exam, I set myself a challenge:  
To use my skills in statistics and programming — not just to study financial risk, but to **build** it.

The result is **XQRiskCore** — my first project in financial risk.  

---

## 🤝 Collaboration & Opportunities

I'm open to:

- ✅ Partnering with funds, quant teams, or compliance leads building auditable risk infrastructure  
- ✅ Projects involving governance-driven strategy execution or automated trade control  
- ✅ Roles in **quant/risk engineering**, **approval architecture**, or **institutional risk governance**

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

I built XQRiskCore with help from large language models — not just as tools, but as thinking partners.  
**ChatGPT** helped architect logic, **DeepSeek** visualized workflows, and **Gemini** challenged the structure.

I’m deeply grateful to my PhD advisors, **Associate Professor Allan McRae** and **Dr. Fleur Garton**, whose modeling discipline shaped much of the system’s architecture.

Two ideas guided this project from the ground up:

- **Charlie Munger’s latticework thinking**, which taught me to cross-pollinate abstractions from genetics to finance.  
- **Warren Buffett’s lesson from LTCM** — that “you can’t survive a margin call even if you’re right” — which defined my priority: discipline over brilliance.

Without those principles, this system would not exist — at least not in this form.
